# Ideal-Travel-Destinations-in-Sabah-Classification-Project
In this study, we utilize data collected from UMS students to classify their travel preferences into three primary categories: Beaches, Mountains, and Islands in Sabah, Malaysia. By analysing variables such as demographics, travel history, and expectations, we aim to discover patterns and trends in student preferences.
